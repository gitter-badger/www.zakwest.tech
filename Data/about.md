# About me
Hi, my name is Zak West and I'm a student at the University of York. I'm currently in my second year of a Electronics and Computing Engineering Masters. So far I'm really enjoying the course and doing pritty well (if i do say so myself). 

I decided to create this website so that i can have a place to share the projects that ive been working on, and the ideas that have been on my mind. I'll be writting [blog posts][Blog_Link] about university assesments, open scource projects i've contributing, an other stuff (like [Ludum Dare][LD_Link]).
